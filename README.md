# Heart-Disease-Predictiction
The aim of the project is to hasten heart disease diagnosis by about 30% to save doctors and medical practitioners time. Various classifier models were built with health dataset (about 70,000 records). The models were evaluated with accuracy and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Prior to model building, the given dataset was analysed and some interesting insights were uncovered.
